      <h2>52 Games In A Year</h2>
      <p>The challenge is quite simple - try to beat 52 games in the current year. This is a feature challenge for the website and has its own dedicated page right <a href="/yearly-challenge-2026">here</a>. Click on "The Challenge" box to get the rules and stipulations for a game to be considered "beat".</p>

      <h2>Kaizo Hack Clears</h2>
      <p>As an homage to the legendary Dode, I have the very unobtainable goal of beating every Kaizo Light hack on SMW Central. I’m still a relative noob to the genre, but have been slowly getting better and conquering hack after hack.</p>

      <h2>Fall Guys Crowns</h2>
      <p>Fall Guys came outta nowhere and is now my most played game of the last decade. This challenge is to win, win and win crowns. The ultimate goal is crown level 50 for the legendary Golden Knight costume... but that's going to take 3039 crowns, so it could be a while.</p>

      <h2>Enter the Gungeon: Lich Streak with Paradox</h2>
      <p>Originally the triple threat rogue-like challenge, this has now been shifted to a more dedicated challenge of reaching and beating Lich with the character Paradox. This means we are bringing a randomized build to take on one of the toughest runs in all of rogue-likes and trying to take down an infamously difficult final boss</p>
